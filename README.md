## Approach

Weather Week was crafted with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), leveraging its efficient [/app routing schema](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing). The application relies on the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch location and weather forecast data. In terms of styling, [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) was chosen for its ability to generate CSS files at build time, resulting in a zero-runtime impact. This powerful tool not only facilitates the creation of styles but also allows for the development of custom utility classes, ensuring a cohesive and type-safe styling experience across the entire project.
